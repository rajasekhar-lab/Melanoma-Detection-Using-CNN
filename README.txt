General Information
Background: Melanoma is one of the deadliest forms of skin cancer, and early detection significantly improves treatment outcomes. The goal of this project is to create a machine learning solution to help in the early detection of melanoma from images of skin lesions.
Business Problem: Melanoma accounts for a large portion of skin cancer deaths, and manual detection by dermatologists can be time-consuming and prone to human error. A reliable model can assist medical professionals by providing quick and accurate evaluations.
Dataset: The dataset used for this project is from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). It contains 2357 images of various skin lesions categorized into nine different types of diseases, including melanoma. The dataset includes:
Actinic keratosis
Basal cell carcinoma
Dermatofibroma
Melanoma
Nevus
Pigmented benign keratosis
Seborrheic keratosis
Squamous cell carcinoma
Vascular lesion
Conclusions
Model Performance: The custom CNN model achieves competitive accuracy in classifying skin lesion images into different categories, with a particular focus on detecting melanoma.
Data Augmentation Impact: Data augmentation techniques, including random rotations, zoom, and horizontal/vertical flips, improved the model's generalization and reduced overfitting.
Class Imbalance Resolution: Strategies like class rebalancing and oversampling helped address class imbalances, ensuring the model performs well across all classes.
Practical Application: This model can be integrated into clinical systems, aiding dermatologists in diagnosing skin lesions with higher efficiency and accuracy, especially in regions with limited access to specialists.
